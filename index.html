<p>So, what happens at cadets? Well, in short, a lot! Throughout the year, cadets meet mostly on Thursday nights. On one of these training nights, cadets arrive at 18:15 (that’s 6:15pm) and have a small amount of time to talk to their friends and socialize, until the opening parade at 6:30. During this parade, we do drill (marching, etc), take attendance, and then go over the schedule for the night. After the opening parade, we usually have a couple of half hour “classes”. Don’t worry, this isn’t like school. Most lessons are really activities, and you’ll learn about things from how to tie knots to identifying military ranks to how to use a map and compass and many many things in between. At 20:00, we have a break where cadets can socialize and buy food and drinks from our canteen. After break, we usually have another lesson, but sometimes we have drill practice or do some other activity. Then, at the end of the night, we have a quick debrief before everyone goes home at 21:00 (9:00pm).</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<h3>History Of Army Cadets</h3>
<p>More than one hundred years ago (as far back as 1862) Canada began the instruction of young men attending school in drill and military training. These young men were initially formed into militia sub-units known as Drill Associations that closely resemble present-day cadet corps.</p>
<p>In 1879, under the provision of Militia General Order 18, Associations for Drill in Educational Institutions were authorized for young men of at least 14 years of age. This General Order is taken as the official founding date of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets.</p>
<p>In 1942, His Majesty King George VI conferred the title Royal on the Army cadets and accepted the appointment of Colonel-in-Chief.  Today, HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, holds this title.</p>
<p>During the 1960's, the Canadian Forces underwent a complete reorganization and as a result the Directorate of Cadets was established at National Defence Headquarters to set policy and coordinate the activities of the Canadian Cadet Organization on a national basis.</p>
<p>Bill C16 was given Royal Assent on July 30, 1975 and amended the National Defence Act allowing young women to enroll as cadets.  Prior to this date, cadets was a male-only organization.</p>
<p>The Canadian Cadet Movement is the largest youth organization in Canada, and is the only federally funded youth initiative.  We have corps and squadrons in every province and territory, and currently have over 55,000 members!</p>

<h3>History Of Our Corps</h3>
<p>3005 RCACC was originally formed 1 Sep 1956 under the sponsorship of the Canadian Scottish Regiment and affiliated with same. It was disbanded 9 Apr 1959.</p>
<p>The corps reformed 15 Jul 1989 as 2598 Sidney Signal Cadet Corps. It is sponsored by the BC Army Cadet League and co-sponsored and affiliated with the 741 (Victoria) Comm Sqdn.</p>
<p>On 13 May 1992, the name changed from 2598 Sidney Signal Corps to 3005 Sidney Signal Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps. This was done to allow the corps to use the corps flag and memorabilia of the 3005 unit, from the same area.</p>
<p>During 1994, a redesignation and a sponsor change occurred. The sponsor became the Branch 12, Army, Navy, Airforce Veterans Association and the corps name changed to its present moniker: 3005 11 Service Batallion Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps affiliated with the 11 (Victoria) Service Battalion located in the Ashton Armoury.</p>
