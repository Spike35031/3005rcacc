<h1>Welcome Back &amp; Sgt. Schofield&#39;s Age-out</h1>

<p>Hello cadets! I hope everyone enjoyed their summer. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear your stories.</p>

<p>We are back to cadets this Thursday 8 September and it is a special night. Sgt Schofield will be aging out so it will be a parade our first night back.</p>

<p>You have plenty of time so ensure your uniforms are clean and pressed, your hair is cut and your shoes, polished. No excuses to not have a uniform on. I&rsquo;m sure Sgt Schofield would appreciate everyone in attendance and dressed appropriately.</p>

<p>We have a very exciting year planned that the staff are excited to share with you.</p>

<p>See you Thursday!</p>

<p>Capt Fearn</p>
