Hello cadets! I hope everyone enjoyed their summer. I can't wait to hear your stories. 

We are back to cadets this Thursday 8 September and it is a special night. Sgt Schofield will be aging out so it will be a parade our first night back.

You have plenty of time so ensure your uniforms are clean and pressed, your hair is cut and your shoes, polished. No excuses to not have a uniform on. I'm sure Sgt Schofield would appreciate everyone in attendance and dressed appropriately. 

We have a very exciting year planned that the staff are excited to share with you. 

See you Thursday!

Capt Fearn
